# Interacted-Anti-patterns

Data for "Are Anti-patterns Coupled? An Empirical Study" (QRS'17)
    
Anti-patterns exist in software may bring potential risks to software quality, increasing maintenance difficulties. By conducting an 
in-depth and comprehensive study on anti-patterns, this project aims to develop new techniques and tools to detect, prevent, and refactor 
anti-patterns. My work focuses on the inter-relationships among multiple kinds of anti-patterns and their impact on software maintenance.
Recently, researchers have paid attention to the impact of multiple anti-patterns in the same artifact. They concluded that some inter-
pattern relations are associated with problems during software maintenance, and intensify the negative impact of individual anti-patterns. 
In addition, antipattern interactions are not manifested only within one artifact. Correlated anti-patterns distributed across coupled 
artifacts have comparable negative effects as when they are co-located. These studies imply that further analyses on interacted anti-
patterns will lead to a more complete understanding of the relationship between anti-patterns and software maintainability. However, 
little work provides empirical evidences for anti-patterns interaction, into which we are willing to make a preliminary investigation.

Specifically, the goal of this study is to explore which pairs of anti-patterns interact with each other, that is, tend to be coupled.
We seek to answer the following research questions:

●RQ1 (co-located anti-patterns): which pairs of antipatterns tend to be coupled in the same class?       

●RQ2 (dependent anti-patterns): which pairs of anti-patterns tend to be coupled in inter-dependent classes?

●RQ3 (co-changed anti-patterns): which pairs of anti-patterns tend to be coupled in co-changed classes?
